Nestled in a large back yard with its own patio, it is a five block walk to Cal and a 15 minute walk to BART (a 5 minute bus ride).\n\nIn the past visiting scholars, professionals and graduate student couples have found the cottage a perfect fit. Those who have lived in SF find they get twice the space and yard for what they would pay in the City. The upstairs has 1 bedroom which opens onto a plus room that can be used as a study, for guest stays or another bedroom. While the plus room has been used for a bedroom it does not have a door. The cottage cannot accommodate more than three people. Ads for more than that will not be answered. One or two people are the ideal fit.\n\nThe house has a highly functional layout including a dining room, living room, full kitchen, private laundry room with washer/dryer, extra storage areas, and a patio. The living room currently has a daybed/couch that is perfect for guests staying over. The patio deck is surrounded by greenery. You can study, relax or have friends over. \n\nDepending on length of stay, the cottage can come completely furnished, including dishes and pots and pans, this renovated cottage is indeed a rare find. Economize, as you won't have to spend the time or energy on furnishings. This is especially advantageous if you don't have a car to carry large furniture.\n\nFormerly the owner's home, the cottage is deceptively rustic. Beneath the charm are all new plumbing and electrical. The living room has a porcelain gas heater that is not only a charming period heater but is inexpensive to run and state of the art in providing heat. This cottage is particularly nice as it's off the street and located in a large back yard with a magnificent oak tree. A larger Edwardian home occupies the front of the property. \n\nThe residents in the front house are mostly grad students and postdocs. It's very homey yet private. The people here are responsible without being picky; respectful, especially of study time, but social. Dinner parties are common but no big parties (10 people or more) or loud events out of respect for the restored house, neighbors and the good chance that one would get fined by BPD (now up to $750) for a loud party.\n\nThe house is located in the south of campus between the Elmwood and the Telegraph areas. You can walk south a couple of blocks and be in the upscale Elmwood or a few blocks north and be in the University/Telegraph area. You can catch a bus by walking two blocks either way. As mentioned, BART (the subway) is about a 15 minute walk. \n\nThis is a University neighborhood with fairly high density. The cottage is surrounded by greenery and private but there are tall buildings in this area. Next door is a graduate student coop. They have dinners outside when the weather is nice. Because the cottage is in the back most of the undergraduate student noise is not intrusive. \n\nThe owner is dedicated to provided the best housing possible and is responsive to all repair requests. \n\nFinancial aspect: Rent is $2895 with a two month deposit. This rent is for two people or a couple with a child. Add $250 for an additional person. The lease term is from June 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017. Utilities are paid by tenant. A coveted off street parking spot is available for $100 per month. No smoking or pets. Due to allergies, absolutely no cats.

Built in the early 1920s, the building has all the\ncharm and character you would expect from an Elmwood home. You'll have access\nto a beautiful shared back garden that features luxurious cool grass and a\npaved stone area perfect for sitting with a glass of iced tea on a warm summer\nday.\n\nThe building's prominent windows open to welcome cool spring breezes and close to allow the warm autumn light to filter through. The spacious rooms and hardwood floors, combined with the wonderful natural light, give each apartment a welcoming, homey feel. Enjoy lazy Sunday morning breakfasts at your large eat-in kitchen, complete with a gas stove. The super large 3 bedroom apartment takes up the southern half of the top\u00a0floor and has beautiful hardwood floors, a spacious\u00a0kitchen and tons of natural lighting from the surrounding windows in the unit. It is a truly amazing place and one-of-a-kind must see! In addition, there is a shared garden in the back of the property with fruit trees and on-site laundry.\nNeighborhood InformationNeighborhood description\n\nLocated in the heart of the Historic Elmwood District, this building is literally steps away from Zagat-rated restaurants, bustling small-town\u00a0vibes,\u00a0vintage & fashion\u00a0stores, gourmet boutiques and countless cafes. UC campus is only 20 minutes walking, or less than 10 minutes on AC Transit 51 line.

The pride of Oakland's school system for 52 years, this grand building features art deco brick-and-molded-terracotta facade detail rare to find in a residential setting. This ground-floor loft features high ceilings throughout with upgraded architectural design features like a raised bamboo floor, corrugated aluminum siding in spots and a flowing waterfall which can give a zen-like feel and sound, among others. With its large double-paned windows and the beautiful daytime natural light creates the perfect atmosphere for a creative tenant. The very large main space includes an ample, well-equipped kitchen and dining area. The large bathroom has a shower/tub combo, washer and dryer. \n\nCreate your own living layout in this spacious unit that is plenty large enough for a couple. No one is living below, above or around you in the large main space, which gives you the freedom to work late, make noise or watch movies at any hour of the night, making this a truly unique environment. There is simply nothing like it on the market now. Right above, a virtually private deck enables you to sit or barbecue outdoors. There are windows on three sides that allow a sweet marine bay cross-breeze if opened, never getting too hot in summer. Just outside, apple, peach and Asian pears produce fruit in season and lemon trees offer their bounty year-round. There are three common area outside decks that can be used by anyone. This unit has tons of soul and emits creative energy from the solid concrete that housed young children learning and at play for 60 years! They can't build buildings like this anymore. \n\nThe 28-unit building houses an artist/young professional community and the unit itself was previously occupied by a renown artist.

In the mid-1970's, the building became Oakland's foray into creating a public school dedicated to the arts. Dogtown Developers purchased the building from Oakland Unified School District in 1999, after it closed in 1979, and renovated it to create these unique and amazing live/work lofts.\n", "title": "One of a Kind Artist's Live/Work Loft!", "price": "$3640", "longitude": "-122.282338", "gmap": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+%33%32%34%30+Peralta+St%2E+Unit+Oakland+CA+US", "images": ["http://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_iQ4cKQ2AR7U_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_lupQJMTyJpz_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_dzrn2naP1cK_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_lenUmyKkB0r_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/01717_eSGgHQA2yuv_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_bxMr8p9aih5_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00808_5oqk6bIcHgA_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/01717_dFJIiwdYBXX_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/01616_8UlpFfxFla8_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00O0O_c5Qv2wZi4vW_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_6GdkB0A1skn_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/01010_eBq9keAOeIR_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_lwNjf6UfhD6_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00303_joK2NemE84x_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_jTEYxIQF8y1_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_97UxXnWt0GL_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_2uWWkLwPREV_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_fNaLXySnBQJ_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_J3HXGO01ES_600x450.jpg"], "open_house": "sunday 2016-04-03", "latitude": "37.825006", "size": "/ 1br - 1601ft2 - "}, "https://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/5519485729.html": {"city": " (berkeley)", "features": "\nTWO BEDROOM AVAILABLE JUNE 3.

Nestled in a large back yard with its own patio, it is a five block walk to Cal and a 15 minute walk to BART (a 5 minute bus ride).\n\nIn the past visiting scholars, professionals and graduate student couples have found the cottage a perfect fit. Those who have lived in SF find they get twice the space and yard for what they would pay in the City. The upstairs has 1 bedroom which opens onto a plus room that can be used as a study, for guest stays or another bedroom. While the plus room has been used for a bedroom it does not have a door. The cottage cannot accommodate more than three people. Ads for more than that will not be answered. One or two people are the ideal fit.\n\nThe house has a highly functional layout including a dining room, living room, full kitchen, private laundry room with washer/dryer, extra storage areas, and a patio. The living room currently has a daybed/couch that is perfect for guests staying over. The patio deck is surrounded by greenery. You can study, relax or have friends over. \n\nDepending on length of stay, the cottage can come completely furnished, including dishes and pots and pans, this renovated cottage is indeed a rare find. Economize, as you won't have to spend the time or energy on furnishings. This is especially advantageous if you don't have a car to carry large furniture.\n\nFormerly the owner's home, the cottage is deceptively rustic. Beneath the charm are all new plumbing and electrical. The living room has a porcelain gas heater that is not only a charming period heater but is inexpensive to run and state of the art in providing heat. This cottage is particularly nice as it's off the street and located in a large back yard with a magnificent oak tree. A larger Edwardian home occupies the front of the property. \n\nThe residents in the front house are mostly grad students and postdocs. It's very homey yet private. The people here are responsible without being picky; respectful, especially of study time, but social. Dinner parties are common but no big parties (10 people or more) or loud events out of respect for the restored house, neighbors and the good chance that one would get fined by BPD (now up to $750) for a loud party.\n\nThe house is located in the south of campus between the Elmwood and the Telegraph areas. You can walk south a couple of blocks and be in the upscale Elmwood or a few blocks north and be in the University/Telegraph area. You can catch a bus by walking two blocks either way. As mentioned, BART (the subway) is about a 15 minute walk. \n\nThis is a University neighborhood with fairly high density. The cottage is surrounded by greenery and private but there are tall buildings in this area. Next door is a graduate student coop. They have dinners outside when the weather is nice. Because the cottage is in the back most of the undergraduate student noise is not intrusive. \n\nThe owner is dedicated to provided the best housing possible and is responsive to all repair requests. \n\nFinancial aspect: Rent is $2895 with a two month deposit. This rent is for two people or a couple with a child. Add $250 for an additional person. The lease term is from June 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017. Utilities are paid by tenant. A coveted off street parking spot is available for $100 per month. No smoking or pets. Due to allergies, absolutely no cats. Email Michelle with a little information about yourself if you are interested. \n\nNote: the furnishings change from time to time and may be different from those in the pictures.\n", "title": "Elegant 2-story cottage minutes from Cal and BART", "price": "$2895", "longitude": "-122.256980", "gmap": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+Hillegass+at+Parker+Berkeley+CA+US", "images": ["http://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_9rtQ0u1QOJ1_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_2pjCfWwKHfa_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_kMl9vZBvG2f_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_jKLURDqftiz_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_c3dY86zOeGi_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_9zFqEErwFl9_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_2UeJhWHGmiM_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_lp0UptWMNqd_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_2NXx2pvz4a4_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_2YHBhVIoQvN_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00R0R_fXTjVYQbLmv_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_dQYS6ZssaPS_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/01515_c7md4aN7n6t_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_1OYpcEmWTcX_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/01313_bKUvE97Vc6h_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_bUMVIV0Bfev_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_bEA7IykNQUD_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_b6mHkTpO01T_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_8lVtySlewA3_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_laIYfgGbs0J_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00B0B_luG5hErngOD_600x450.jpg"], "open_house": "n/a", "latitude": "37.863626", "size": "/ 2br - "}, "https://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/5512964914.html": {"city": " (oakland piedmont / montclair)", "features": "\nCharming lower-level flat w/ private entrance that looks out on large shared patio & yard.

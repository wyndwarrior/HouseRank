Urban living in the apartments homes of Icon at Doyle in Emeryville.  There are cities. And then there is Emeryville. To outsiders, it seems like a small town. Yet the more you explore, the more there is to discover. A mere block from your home, you may find world-class jazz, stylish restaurants and zen-like gardens. This is also a city built on a thriving artistic heritage. In fact, art is so woven into the community, you never know where a thought - provoking sculpture, painting or prose may find itself in your path. It doesn't hurt that this vibrant city also spoils you with an ideal climate and location. You're just moments from the I80 and I580 freeways, which means wine country, premier universities and nature escapes are all part of Emeryville's rich lifestyle.

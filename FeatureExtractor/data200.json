Your rent would be $1450 per month (half of total $2900, prorated), plus half of utilities/internet (about $35/person a month). Asking a $500 deposit to cover a portion of the total deposit I paid when I moved in. THIS IS A SUMMER OPPORTUNITY ONLY - I WILL NOT BE RENEWING THE LEASE PAST AUGUST 17, 2016.\n\nThe apartment:\nYou get your own medium-sized bedroom with your own sliding glass door to our great balcony with a view of (a tiny sliver of) the Bay Bridge! One small bathroom with two sinks and a separate toilet/shower. Kitchen has a gas oven/range, no dishwasher. I have most appliances/utensils you would want. Living room has a TV with netflix, amazon, HBO (but not cable), a couch and a couple of comfy recliners. Laundry in building, and garage parking in building also available for $100/month. Only a couple blocks from campus, and nearly everyone else in the building is a Cal student. 10 minute walk to Downtown Berkeley BART and everything else downtown Berkeley has to offer.\n\nAbout me:\nMy name is Brad and I'm from western Massachusetts. I'm 23 and I just graduated from college on the east coast with a degree in Psychology and moved out here in June for a job very close to the apartment. I work pretty much 8-5 every day, sometimes longer, and in the evenings I often play records, practice the acoustic guitar (I'm a beginner), or use my rowing machine (you'd be welcome to use it too!). These all make a little noise, even if I shut my bedroom door, so you'd have to be okay with that. I don't have any dietary restrictions or allergies, but I'm willing to be accommodating if you do. I like to make cheese, I love to drink whisky, and I enjoy a good film.\n\nMy ideal flatmate: \nAll genders/ages/types welcome! I'm gay, so you have to be cool with that. I like to be social, but not all the time. Hopefully you want to hang out sometimes but you're also happy doing your own thing. I typically go to bed around 10:30-11:30pm (later on weekends), so it might be nice to have similar schedules but that's definitely not a deal breaker. Undergrad or grad students are very welcome and the apartment is really close to campus and perfect for students. I'm not the neatest guy in the world, but I like to keep things relatively tidy. Ideally we both pick up after ourselves but neither of us freaks out if a dirty dish sits in the sink overnight. No tobacco smokers, please.\n", "title": "You pay $1450/mo for 1BR in 2BR, 1BA close to UCB SUMMER", "price": "$1450", "longitude": "-122.262962", "gmap": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+dwight+way+at+ellsworth+berkeley+CA+US", "images": ["http://images.craigslist.org/00000_48Ggb2wKQVQ_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00707_2W6X0McPkJG_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00000_gkTlgyw1YpZ_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_7bXReP9odPH_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00101_2A8Sx6Y0RFw_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00101_dhd2owWSSIX_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_ik7bVqtiYUI_600x450.jpg"], "open_house": "n/a", "latitude": "37.864504", "size": "/ 2br - "}, "https://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/5509446191.html": {"city": " (oakland piedmont / montclair)", "features": "\nOpen House Saturday 1-2 PM.

Very quiet space in back of lot (not visible from street). Natural wood doors/trim, hand-plastered walls, bamboo floors. Six years ago the house was completely rebuilt, from the foundation and framing, to the doors, windows, equipment, wall finishes and trim -- everything you can see and almost everything you can't see was new.\n\nOne of the most environmentally-conscious rentals in the region: \n* Your electricity comes from the sun -- powered by solar panels on the roof.\n* Insulation 2x more effective than typical fiberglass (walls about R-26). Double-pane windows.\n* On heat wave days tenants close the windows in the morning and the house remains cooler than outdoors until late in the afternoon, although the house gets full sun.\n* 95% efficient furnace heats 3 separate zones with programmable thermostats, 95% high-efficiency water heater\n* Metal roof that will last a lifetime and is recyclable. \n* Dual-flush toilet, dishwasher and clothes washer with the highest energy efficiency ratings available. \n* Recessed ceiling lights with dimmer/occupancy switches that exceed code. \n* Professionally engineered foundation / shear walls / holddowns to resist shaking. \n* FSC-certified hardwood decking. \n\nUpstairs (750 sq. ft. interior): \n* 2 small bedrooms, about 110-120 sq. ft. each. no closets. \n* full bath - tile floor \n* kitchen/living area that opens onto: \n* 300 sq. ft. deck. \n\nDownstairs: \n* 340 sq. ft. room that also has views of the bay and Mt. Tam. This room was redone at the same time as the whole house and finished just like upstairs - natural plaster walls, bamboo floors, recessed lighting, etc.\n* Laundry/utility room ~ 100 sq. ft. \n* Downstairs has its own exterior door, which is the only way to get in (you must go outside, down deck stairs -- see photos).\n\nViews: \n* from Albany Hill north to San Pablo Bay, including GG Bridge, Mt. Tam. Sunset views year round, from winter to summer solstice. \n\nEquipment: \n* CAT5 network jacks & cable TV jacks in every room. \n* Forced air heat to every room -- modern furnace/duct system. \n* Gas stove & oven, garbage disposal, dishwasher, clothes washer & dryer, laundry sink \n* Solar panels provide enough power to meet average electricity demand in the house, which is on the grid, so power is available at all times (during peak solar production, credit is earned for sending power back to the grid, which offsets usage when the panels are not producing). \n\nOutdoors: \n* Share a 11,000 sq. ft. lot with the main, owner-occupied house. \n* The gentle slope of our hill has been landscaped into two large terraces including a 1500 sq. ft. flat lawn watered with high-efficiency underground emitters. \n* The street parking space in front of the main house is reserved by us for tenants (to the extent that any public space can be reserved). Rarely someone will take the reserved space, but there are always street spaces available within 50 ft.\n\nNeighborhood: \n* Kensington/Hilltop Elementary school district \n* Although it has wide open views, the house is in the gentle hills, so walking or biking to commercial districts is possible. \n* Huber Park is one block away \n* .3 miles to El Cerrito tennis courts / town pool / Cerrito Vista park \n* .4 miles to home roasted neighborhood cafe: Well Grounded Tea and Coffee Bar: http://www.yelp.com/biz/well-grounded-tea-and-coffee-bar-el-cerrito \n* .8 miles to El Cerrito Natural Grocery / Library (and don't forget Down Home Music...) \n* 1.3 miles to El Cerrito BART / El Cerrito Plaza (Trader Joe's, Barnes & Noble, many more... ) \n\nWe'll plan an open house in the next week or two. \n", "title": "Solar home, views, large yard", "price": "$3000", "longitude": "-122.298500", "gmap": "https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@37.915600,-122.298500,16z", "images": ["http://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_f5LJxtbphyy_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_llHdSrqXhR8_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_cY3i1EpTMA1_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_gHJANfWoWf2_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_ggGVire1JKx_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00O0O_1gGBrhrlHr6_600x450.jpg"], "open_house": "n/a", "latitude": "37.915600", "size": "/ 2br - 1200ft2 - "}, "https://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/5509438244.html": {"city": " (oakland piedmont / montclair)", "features": "\n2 bedroom, 1 Bathroom blocks (.5 mile) off Piedmont Ave. Available Immediately.

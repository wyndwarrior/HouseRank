I need someone I can trust and can live peacefully with. \n\nI'm alcohol and 420 friendly, but we've all had that crazy roommate that takes it too far right? As long as it's in moderation, you're responsible, and don't turn the place into a party house.\n\nWalking distance to Shattuck and Telegraph, all the great Berkeley eateries, The F Bus comes right by the house (TransBay to San Francisco), walking distance to Downtown Berkeley Bart. Very easy to get around.\n\nReally cool and safe neighborhood, great for students, close to Cal. It is definitely a college student neighborhood with a few families and locals.\n\nRent is only $800 a month, asking for a $900 security deposit. Prefer to live with students that are women, but open to everyone especially if they have a job and too.\n\nLets meet at Peet's Coffee on Telegraph and discuss. If we get along, the place is yours!
